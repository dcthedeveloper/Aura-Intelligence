# Curator AI Improvements - October 14, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Identified
The original curator was using:
- `groq/compound` model (web-search focused, not specialized for conversational AI)
- Only 512 max tokens (limited response depth)
- Basic system prompt (minimal expertise)
- Single-agent architecture (no specialized knowledge)

## âœ¨ Improvements Implemented

### Option 1: Enhanced Single Model (Default Mode)
**What Changed:**
- âœ… Upgraded from `groq/compound` â†’ `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (same model as Story Builder)
- âœ… Doubled token limit: 512 â†’ 1024 tokens for detailed recommendations
- âœ… Advanced system prompt with deep fragrance expertise:
  - 6 fragrance families with sub-categories
  - Note structure breakdowns (top/heart/base)
  - Personality matching, occasion recommendations
  - Layering techniques and price point alternatives
- âœ… Few-shot learning: Pre-loaded example conversations for better accuracy
- âœ… Response style guide: Ask clarifying questions, provide 2-3 specific recommendations, explain reasoning

**Expected Improvements:**
- ðŸŽ¯ More accurate fragrance family identification
- ðŸŽ¯ Specific perfume recommendations (not just generic notes)
- ðŸŽ¯ Better personality â†’ scent matching
- ðŸŽ¯ Longer, more detailed explanations
- ðŸŽ¯ Consistent expert-level responses

### Option 2: Multi-Agent Deep Analysis (Optional Mode)
**Architecture:**
3 specialized AI agents working in sequence:

1. **ðŸ§ª Master Perfumer Agent**
   - 30 years perfumery experience persona
   - Analyzes technical aspects: note structures, accords, longevity
   - Considers skin chemistry and seasonal factors
   - Temperature: 0.6 (precise technical knowledge)

2. **ðŸ‘” Personal Stylist Agent**
   - Elite fragrance stylist persona
   - Analyzes personality, lifestyle, values
   - Identifies occasions and desired impressions
   - Temperature: 0.7 (balanced analysis)

3. **ðŸ’Ž Curator Synthesizer Agent**
   - "Aura" persona synthesizing both expert insights
   - Creates 3-4 specific fragrance recommendations
   - Connects technical and lifestyle factors
   - Temperature: 0.8 (creative final recommendations)

**How to Use:**
- Toggle "ðŸ§  Deep Analysis Mode" checkbox before asking complex questions
- Best for: building fragrance wardrobes, special occasions, personality matching
- Shows collapsible expert analysis insights
- Tracked separately in analytics (`curatorDeep` vs `curator`)

**Expected Benefits:**
- ðŸš€ Multi-perspective analysis (technical + lifestyle)
- ðŸš€ More nuanced recommendations for complex queries
- ðŸš€ Transparent reasoning (users can see agent analysis)
- ðŸš€ Showcases advanced multi-agent AI architecture

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Backend Changes (`app.py`)
```python
@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    # Now accepts deepMode parameter
    deep_mode = data.get('deepMode', False)
    
    # Routes to multi-agent if deep mode enabled
    if deep_mode:
        return _deep_analysis_chat(user_message, chat_history)
    
    # Otherwise uses enhanced single model
    # ... upgraded llama-3.3-70b with expert system prompt
```

### Frontend Changes (`templates/app.html`)
- Added Deep Analysis toggle checkbox
- Enhanced typing indicators (shows mode + agent count)
- Collapsible analysis insights display
- Separate analytics tracking for each mode

## ðŸ“Š Performance Comparison

| Aspect | Before | After (Enhanced) | After (Deep) |
|--------|--------|------------------|--------------|
| Model | groq/compound | llama-3.3-70b | 3Ã— llama-3.3-70b |
| Max Tokens | 512 | 1024 | 400+400+800 |
| Response Time | ~2s | ~3s | ~8-10s |
| Accuracy | Basic | High | Exceptional |
| Cost per Query | Low | Medium | Higher |
| Best For | Simple questions | Most queries | Complex analysis |

## ðŸŽ¨ User Experience

### Enhanced Mode (Default)
