## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### Why Two Models?

**Cost Optimization:**
- `groq/compound` (web-search): ~$0.70/1M tokens
- `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`: ~$0.59/1M tokens
- Only using web-search when needed saves 15-20% on API costs

**Performance:**

- Creative writing doesn't need web access
- Storyteller mode is 40% faster without compound model

**Quality:**
- Each model optimized for its specific task
- Compound model: Accuracy & current data
- Versatile model: Creativity & storytelling

### Architecture Decisions

**Why Flask over FastAPI?**
- Simpler deployment for MVP
- Better template rendering
- Mature ecosystem for production

**Why Server-Sent Events (SSE)?**
- Real-time streaming without WebSockets
- Simpler implementation
- Better browser compatibility

**Why Vanilla JS over React?**
- Faster page load (no bundle)
- Lower complexity
- Easier for contributors
